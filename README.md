# Google_DA_Certificate_Case_Study01_Cyclistic
This repository is created as a case study about a fictional bike-sharing company to complete the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

The original dataset can be found [here] (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

I used the data from 2022-03 to 2023-02.
